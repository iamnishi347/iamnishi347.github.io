        <p>
            The discovery of new materials has traditionally relied on intuition-driven experiments and
            computational trial-and-error. In recent years, <strong>machine learning (ML)</strong> has emerged
            as a transformative tool in computational materials science, enabling rapid screening of vast
            chemical spaces and accelerating the discovery of functional materials.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Machine Learning for Materials?</h2>
        <p>
            First-principles methods such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) are accurate but computationally
            expensive. Exploring millions of candidate materials using direct DFT calculations is often
            infeasible. Machine learning models provide an efficient alternative by learning patterns from
            existing data and making fast predictions at negligible computational cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Data-Driven Materials Science</h2>
        <p>
            At the core of ML-based materials discovery lies data. Large databases generated from high-throughput
            DFT calculations now serve as training grounds for predictive models.
        </p>

        <p>
            Common data sources include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Computed materials databases (structures, energies, band gaps)</li>
            <li>Experimental property datasets</li>
            <li>Simulated thermodynamic and mechanical properties</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Material Representations</h2>
        <p>
            A crucial step in applying ML is encoding materials into numerical representations that models
            can understand. Common representations include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Composition-based descriptors</li>
            <li>Local atomic environment fingerprints</li>
            <li>Graph-based crystal representations</li>
            <li>Wannier- and orbital-inspired features</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
        <p>
            Several ML techniques are widely used in materials science:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Linear models:</strong> Simple, interpretable baselines</li>
            <li><strong>Kernel methods:</strong> Gaussian processes for uncertainty-aware predictions</li>
            <li><strong>Neural networks:</strong> Deep learning for complex structure–property relations</li>
            <li><strong>Graph neural networks:</strong> State-of-the-art models for crystalline systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>High-Throughput Screening</h2>
        <p>
            ML models enable rapid evaluation of thousands to millions of materials candidates. A typical
            workflow involves:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Generating candidate structures</li>
            <li>Predicting properties using ML models</li>
            <li>Filtering promising materials</li>
            <li>Validating top candidates with DFT</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Applications in Materials Discovery</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning has already demonstrated success across multiple domains:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Discovery of new thermoelectric materials</li>
            <li>Screening catalysts for energy applications</li>
            <li>Prediction of band gaps and topological properties</li>
            <li>Design of battery and photovoltaic materials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Uncertainty and Model Reliability</h2>
        <p>
            Reliable predictions require uncertainty quantification. Techniques such as ensemble models
            and Bayesian learning help identify when ML predictions can be trusted and when new training
            data is needed.
        </p>

        <h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Limited availability of high-quality training data</li>
            <li>Transferability across chemical spaces</li>
            <li>Interpretability of complex models</li>
            <li>Bias inherited from underlying datasets</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Future Directions</h2>
        <p>
            The future of ML-driven materials discovery lies in tighter integration with first-principles
            methods. Active learning, automated workflows, and physics-informed models are expected to
            further reduce discovery time and computational cost.
        </p>

        <p>
            As computational power and data availability continue to grow, machine learning will play
            an increasingly central role in designing materials with targeted properties.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            Machine learning has reshaped the landscape of computational materials science. By complementing
            first-principles calculations with data-driven models, researchers can explore materials space
            at unprecedented scale and speed, opening new pathways for scientific discovery.
